This repository showcases a mini project I created while honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project consists of a simple webpage with an interactive feature: clicking on an image causes it to change to another image. It serves as a hands-on example of using these web technologies and provides a glimpse into creating dynamic and engaging user experiences. This project serves as a stepping stone in my journey of learning web development and exploring the potential of front-end technologies.

Features:

A static webpage created with HTML and styled using CSS.
Interactive behavior implemented using JavaScript.
Clicking on the image triggers a seamless transition to another image.
Feel free to explore the code and contribute if you have any ideas to enhance this mini project further. It's a testament to my learning process and dedication to improving my web development skills.
